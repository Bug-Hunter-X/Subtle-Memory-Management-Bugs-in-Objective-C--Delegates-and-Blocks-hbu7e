The solution involves careful use of `weak` properties for delegates and `__weak` within blocks to prevent retain cycles:

```objectivec
//Improved MyClass implementation
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyDelegate> delegate;
@property (nonatomic, copy) void (^myBlock)(void);

- (void)someMethod;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    if (self.delegate) {
        [self.delegate myDelegateMethod]; //Check for nil before use
    }
}

- (void)someOtherMethod {
    __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
    self.myBlock = ^{ 
        if (weakSelf) { //Check for nil before use
            [weakSelf doSomething];
        }
    };
}

- (void)doSomething {
  //some code
}
@end
```

By checking for `nil` before using the delegate or within the block, we ensure that we are not sending messages to deallocated objects. Using `__weak` in the block prevents retain cycles.  The use of `copy` for the block ensures that it is not mutated unexpectedly.
