# Subtle Memory Management Bugs in Objective-C: Delegates and Blocks

This repository demonstrates common yet subtle memory management issues in Objective-C that can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. These issues frequently involve improper handling of delegates and blocks, which are essential parts of the Objective-C programming paradigm.

## The Problem

The primary problems highlighted are:

1. **Delegates:**  Sending messages to a deallocated delegate object will result in a crash.  The use of `weak` properties mitigates retain cycles, but doesn't prevent the delegate from being deallocated prematurely.
2. **Blocks and Retain Cycles:**  Blocks, if not handled carefully, can create retain cycles where an object retains a block, which in turn retains the object, preventing proper deallocation.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates best practices for avoiding these issues. The key is careful consideration of object lifecycles and proper use of weak references where appropriate.  For blocks, we show how to correctly use `__weak` to break the retain cycle.
